SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES for developers
----------------------------------------

- File name should conform to:
	packageName_classname

we basically want to prepend every file with the name of 
the package that file belongs to, followed by the specific name 
of the class or whatever that file covers.

- file names should be explicative. From the filename I should be 
able to guess what it contains.

- If the name of the class is made of multiple words, then the file name 
should be all lowercase with underscore separating the 
components words making up the class but the class name itself should be 
ONE single string of words where each subword starts with uppercare letter. 
For instance, if the target class name is: 
	
	vectorEpetraDistributed

and the file belongs to the package "core", then the filename should be:

	core_vector_epetra_distributed


- Include guards should have the filename all capitalized ending with _HPP_ like: 

	CORE_VECTOR_EPETRA_DISTRIBUTED_HPP_


- This library is intended to be a header-only library, but for now we cannot do that 
because Tribits does not support this format. 
So every .hpp file has a corresponding .cc file that is EMPTY and only includes the associated .hpp.
This makes things easier later on, when we remove all cc files. 
So, follow this rule.
