# Overview

Pressio is a collection of repositories providing reduced-order models (ROMs) capabilties.
Specifically, the whole Pressio framework currently includes the following repositories: 

* `pressio`: the main C++ repo containing the actual ROM algorithms;

* `pressio-tutorials`: C++ tutorials explaining how to use `pressio` and its functionalities; 

* `pressio-builder`: an auxiliary repo with bash helper scripts for configuring/building/installing `pressio`, and `pressio-tutorials`.

## License
Pressio is released with the following [LICENSE](./LICENSE).


======================================================================================
## Cloning
To clone `pressio` (provided you have Git) use:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Pressio/pressio.git
```
The recursive option is necessary to clone a git submodule for TriBITS.
TriBITS (https://tribits.org/) provides the development framework for Pressio.


======================================================================================
## Structure 

`pressio` is the main code repository and currently includes the following packages: 

* `mpl`: metaprogramming functionalities;

* `utils`: common functionalities, e.g., I/O helpers, static constants, etc;

* `containers`: data strutures wrappers and linear algebra;

* `apps`: suites of mini-apps used for basic testing;

* `qr`: QR factorization functionalities;

* `svd`: singular value decomposition (SVD) functionalities;

* `solvers`: linear and non-linear solvers (e.g. Gauss-Newton with and without line-search, etc.);

* `ode`: explicit and implict time steppers and integrators;

* `rom`: reduced-order modeling algorithms.

The top-down order used above is informative of the packages' dependency structure and mutual visibility. For example, every package depends on `mpl`, but `qr` depends only on `mpl`, `utils`, `containers`. At the bottom of the hierarchy we have the `rom` package which requires all the others. Each package contains corresponding unit- and regular tests. Splitting the framework into separate packages has several benefits.
* Maintability: `pressio` can be more easily developed and maintained since packages depend on one another through well-defined public interfaces, and appropriate namespaces are used to organize classes within each package.

* Selective usability: This modular framework allows users, if needed, to leverage invidual packages (similarly to Trilinos). For instance, if a user needs/wants just the QR methods, they simply use that package, and all the dependencies are enabled automatically.


======================================================================================
## TPLs
At the time of this writing, `pressio` has only one required dependency, namely Eigen, and a few **optional** ones, namely Gtest, Pybind11, Trilinos, Kokkos, Armadillo, Blas, Lapack, Blaze. This set of TPLs will liekly increase over time as we add support for more external packages, e.g. Petsc. However, one of the key Ã§hoices is that we will keep most dependencies optional.


======================================================================================
## Configuring and Building
Configuring and building `pressio` can be done in two ways: 

* since `pressio` uses TriBITS (which uses CMake), you can use a typical CMake configure/build/install process. Note that some TPLs are needed. 

* by clonig and using the following helper repo: `git clone https://github.com/Pressio/pressio-builder.git`
The advantage of using the helper repo is that it automates the installation of TPLs.  

### Sample building steps

This wiki will be updated over time, but to get started, we provide here basic references to configure `pressio` and build its tests for a few target scenarios. 

* Follow [this](./wiki/build_serial.md) for a basic *serial* build that uses only Gtest and Eigen and it is done with `pressio-builder` (which automatically builds) Gtest, Eigen for you.


======================================================================================
## Disclaimer

* Pressio is work-in-progress. At the time of this writing, it is a fairly young project and things are obviously evolving. Several package would benefit from substantial work on testing and documentation, and this is ongoing. However, `pressio` is functional and has been already tested/deployed on large-scale applications.

*This document is in progress, more detailed info to come soon.*
