# Overview

This C++ library aims to provide leading-edge reduced-order
models (ROMs) capabilities for dynamical systems in science and engineering.
We employ generic programming, and target shared and distributed-memory
applications using arbitrary data-types and diverse programming models.

We believe that the key to develop such a capability from the ground up
is to properly identify the building blocks and modularize them accordingly.
This is exactly the approach we have adopted: the library is broken into
several components such that they can be used independently
and in a self-contained fashion.
One of the main outcome of this is that regardless of your interest in ROMs,
you might find useful some of the components of the library.
