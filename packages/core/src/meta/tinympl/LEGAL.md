The content of the tinympl directory has been adapted/extended/forked 
from the tinympl of DARMA, which in turn was adapted from 
the tinympl project, forked from http://sbabbi.github.io/tinympl
on 2015-12-17.  The tinympl project appears to be no longer maintained. 
The original files contained the following header:

// See http://sbabbi.github.io/tinympl for documentation.

The copyright needs to be incorporated into the new header for ROMPP. 
All of this is legal under the terms of the original tinympl license,

**NOTE** that here we only use a minimal subset of functionalities.
