Unit tests here should be grouped properly.
Maybe do one file for each vector class, for instance.
You have some freedom on how to choose things. 
Overall, let's keep things simple and selfcontained.
So if you are testing a particular feature of something, make it a unit test
well-defined so that it is clearly recognizable.
