Constraints
-----------

Let ``basis_matrix_type`` be equal to ``std::remove_cv_t<BasisMatrixType>``, then we must have:

- :cpp:`std::is_class<basis_matrix_type>::value == true`

- and :cpp:`std::is_copy_constructible<basis_matrix_type>::value == true`

- and :cpp:`std::is_pointer<basis_matrix_type>::value == false`

- and :cpp:`pressio::mpl::is_std_shared_ptr<basis_matrix_type>::value == false`

- and :cpp:`pressio::Traits::<basis_matrix_type>::rank == 2`


Member types
------------

- ``basis_matrix_type``: same as ``std::remove_cv_t<BasisMatrixType>``

Member functions
----------------

Constructors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:memberfunction:`(1)`: constructor accepting an lvalue

  *Parameters*:

  - ``basisMatrix``: the basis matrix object

  - ``spanningSetValue``: value from ``SpanningSet`` to specify whether
    ``basisMatrix`` is a row or column span

  *Preconditions*:

  - ``basisMatrix`` must *represent a linear basis* such that

    - if ``spanningSetValue == SpanningSet::Columns``, ``basisMatrix`` should be *full column rank*

    - if ``spanningSetValue == SpanningSet::Rows``, ``basisMatrix`` should be *full row rank*

  - the following operation ``auto basisMatrixClone = pressio::ops::clone(basisMatrix)``
    conforms to the requirements/semantics as `explained here <ops/clone.html>`__;
    in brief, ``basisMatrixClone`` is an object independent of ``basisMatrix`` and if any
    operation is applied to ``basisMatrixClone`` (or any data it references/uses), they
    do not affect the original ``basisMatrix`` object (or any data it references/uses),
    and viceversa

  *Effects*:

  - makes a new allocation to construct ``basis_`` by invoking the
    copy-constructor as ``basis_(pressio::ops::clone(basisMatrix))``

  *Postconditions*:

  - the constructed object is immutable and ``basis_`` is an
    identical (but distinct) copy of the object ``basisMatrix`` originally
    passed to the constructor. Therefore, this class
    has a clear invariant that is established upon construction.


:memberfunction:`(2)`: constructor accepting an rvalue

  *Parameters*:

  - ``basisMatrix``: the basis matrix object

  - ``spanningSetValue``: value from ``SpanningSet`` to specify whether
    ``basisMatrix`` is a row or column span

  *Preconditions*:

  - ``basisMatrix`` must *represent a linear basis* such that

    - if ``spanningSetValue == SpanningSet::Columns``, ``basisMatrix`` should be *full column rank*

    - if ``spanningSetValue == SpanningSet::Rows``, ``basisMatrix`` should be *full row rank*

  *Effects*:

  - tries to initialize ``basis_`` via move semantics by moving ``basisMatrix``.
    If the type ``basis_matrix_type`` implements move semantics,
    the temporary object is moved-constructed into ``basis_`` and no new
    memory allocation should occur.
    If move semantics are not implemented and the move operation
    falls back to a copy, a new allocation (potentially) occurs.

  *Postconditions*:

  - the constructed object is immutable and ``basis_`` is either
    move constructed from the
    original argument, or is just a copy. As in (1), this class
    has a clear invariant that is established upon construction.

:memberfunction:`(3)`: copy constructor

  *Parameters*:

  - ``other``: another subspace object to be used as source to copy from

  *Effects*:

  - initializes ``basis_`` by calling ``pressio::ops::clone(other.basis_)``,
    therefore the semantics are similar to constructor (1)

  *Postconditions*:

  - the new object will be identical to ``other``

Accessors
^^^^^^^^^

:memberfunction:`(4)`: returns a reference to the basis

   - Note: do NOT use ``const_cast`` on the returned value to modify
     the referenced object, as doing so will break the invariant
     and the immutability of the class.
     If you need a different linear subspace, create a new object.

:memberfunction:`(5)`: returns the dimension of the subspace

  *Effects*: let ``S`` be an instance of the class and ``M`` be the basis matrix
  stored in ``S``, then the method returns ``pressio::ops::extent(basisMatrix, i)``
  where ``i==0`` for a row subspace, and ``i==1`` for a column subspace.

:memberfunction:`(6)`: query if the spanning set is the set of columns

  *Effects*: ``true`` for a column subspace, ``false`` otherwise

:memberfunction:`(7)`: query if the spanning set is the set of rows

  *Effects*: ``true`` for a row subspace, ``false`` otherwise


Notes
^^^^^

.. Important::

   The class models the `VectorSubspace concept <rom_concepts_various/linear_subspace.html>`__.


- the semantics of the class are such that copy and move assignment
  are implicitly deleted by the compiler, so you cannot copy or move assign
  an object of the class. The move constructor is guaranteedd to behave as a copy constructor.

- the immutability and invariance of this class rely on the assumption
  that users do not violate const correctness by const_casting the return of (4).
  Please do not do that!

- the design and semantics of the class functions needs a clarification:
  the intent is to ensure the class *always* has value semantics because
  it nees to work even for template arguments with view semantics.
  Suppose that ``basis`` were an instance of a ``Tpetra::MultiVector``
  or a ``Kokkos::View``, which are both classes with view semantics.
  In such case, if constructor (1) were to simply copy-construct
  ``basis``, it would lead to a shallow copy. This would
  compromise the immutability and invariant of the class,
  since any changes to the original object would be reflected
  in the data member copy-constructed from it.
  Therefore, in constructor (1) and in (3), we rely
  on ``pressio::ops::clone()``, to ensure the correct semantics
  and achieve the desired immutability.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   int main(){
     using basis_t  = Eigen::MatrixXd;
     using space_t  = pressio::rom::LinearSubspace<basis_t>;

     basis_t columnBasis1(56,5);
     // fill such that columns are linearly independent
     space_t space(columnBasis1, space_t::SpanningSet::Columns);
     // space.dimension() == 5

     basis_t columnBasis2(156,5);
     // fill such that columns are linearly independent
     space_t space(std::move(columnBasis2), space_t::SpanningSet::Columns);
     // space.dimension() == 5

     basis_t rowBasis1(3,56);
     // fill such that rows are linearly independent
     space_t space(rowBasis1, space_t::SpanningSet::Rows);
     // space.dimension() == 3


     space_t S1(columnBasis1, space_t::SpanningSet::Columns);
     space_t S2(columnBasis2, space_t::SpanningSet::Columns);

     // S1 = S2;            /*illigal*/

     // S2 = S1;            /*illigal*/

     // S1 = std::move(S2); /*illigal*/

     lspace_t S3 = S1; // calls copy constructor

     lspace_t S4(S1); // calls copy constructor

     lspace_t S5(std::move(S1)); // calls copy constructor
   }




..
   - we intentiatlly chose the name ``BasisMatrixType`` rather than limiting it in scope,
     for example narrowing it to ``basisMatrix``, to be more generic for two
     main reasons:

     1. first, the including the word "matrix" in the name is too constraining
	and tied to an implementation detail, since
	a basis could be as well as abstracted in a different way;

     2. second, this flexibility lets users potentially exploit the power of templates.
	In fact, we envision at least two scenarios: the most basic one
	is when ``basis`` is an instance of a ``basis_matrix_type`` class representing
	a "concrete" matrix (e.g. Eigen::Matrix, Tpetra::MultiVector, etc),
	with its columns or rows containing the basis vectors spanning the space.
	An alternative more flexible (but more complicated to handle) scenario is one
	where ``basis`` is an instance of a class that is NOT a "concrete matrix"
	but an abstraction/wrapper of one. This could be an "expert" usage useful in
	some situations.
