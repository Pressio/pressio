Concept-driven design
=====================

Concept-driven design has been and still is critical in the development of pressio.
Here we describe some fundamental notions that are at the core
of our design approach.


``concept = constraints + axioms``
----------------------------------

In pressio, we follow the approach in "Design of Concept Libraries for C++" (2011)
in defining a concept to be a *meaningful combination of syntactic requirements + axioms/semantics*.
Pure syntax can be fully specified and checked by compilers supporting C++20.
On the contrary, axioms/semantics properties cannot be spelled out and statically checked.
Axioms are, in fact, invariants *assumed* to hold. In the C++ standard, axioms
and semantics are specified/listed as comments. Here, we adopt a different
approach to present axioms (similar to "Design of Concept Libraries for C++", 2011)),
that we believe benefits readability: axioms are explicitly listed using
the keyword "axiom". Note, however, that if you want to compile the concepts below
using a c++20 compiler, you have to comment out all axioms.

The layered design of concepts in pressio
-----------------------------------------

If you read the section above (hopefully you have!), you now know that,
by definition, we interpret concepts are a combination of constraints plus semantics.
Typically, designing concepts is a multi-step process. One good starting point
could be to specify the "syntactic" requirements. Then, one adds to this semantics
requirements and, if needed, revises the syntax, and so on.
This design process is useful because it allows one to create concepts in a
gradual/progressive fashion, as if one were adding one layer at a time.
In pressio, this is exactly what has happened. Some of our deepest concepts
originally started as just syntactic requirements, and then they were improved
by adding more layers. In the documentation, you will notice that some concept
are intentially presented to reflect this layered structure.
More specifically, you will notice that we have designed our concepts
such that they reflect the following layered structure:

.. code:: none

   concepts = constraints + execution/language_axioms + math_axioms

The execution axioms are meant to cover requirements related to the
code execution or other language-related details.
The math axioms instead are meant to cover the mathematical foundations.
Note that not all concepts have both execution and math axioms.

.. warning::

   As stated on the main doc page, until we can upgrade to C++20,
   we cannot officially use them *stricto sensu*.
   Concepts are thus currently enforced in the code via SFINAE.
