pressio is header-\/only, so it does not need to be precompiled and linked to. However, since we use preprocessor directives to conditionally enable/disable code based on target third-\/party libraries, one needs to account for this. See below for the details. 



To use pressio, you need a C++14 compiler. \hypertarget{md_pages_installation_autotoc_md152}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{md_pages_installation_autotoc_md152}
Some parts of {\ttfamily pressio} contain code and implementations that are specific to third-\/party libraries (TPLs). An example is {\ttfamily pressio/ops}, which contains kernels specializations for widely-\/used HPC libraries (e.\+g. Trilinos, Kokkos). The main reason for doing this is that we aim, where possible, to alleviate the user from writing custom operations and allow {\ttfamily pressio} to decide when and how to leverage the native libraries\textquotesingle{} operations to obtain the best performance. This should facilitate the integration and use of {\ttfamily pressio} by existing applications. This is a growing capability and we currently only provide built-\/in support to some external HPC libraries (see below). Obviously, these TPLs-\/specific specializations need to be guarded with preprecessor directives, and enabled only if one can access the TPLs.

Enabling/disabling specific dependencies can be done via the following cmake variables\+:

\hypertarget{md_pages_installation_autotoc_md153}{}\doxysubsection{Optional vs Required}\label{md_pages_installation_autotoc_md153}
Eigen is the only required dependency because it is the default choice for instantiating the ROM data structures and solving the (dense) ROM problem.

Obviously, the choice of which TPLs to enable is related to your application\textquotesingle{}s dependency requirements. For example, if you have an application that relies on Trilinos data structures and want to use {\ttfamily pressio}, then it makes sense to enable the Trilinos dependency. On the contrary, if you have an application that relies only on Eigen data structures, then it makes sense to only leave only Eigen on and disable the rest.

Also, we note that some of the cmake variables listed above are connected and cannot be turned on individualy. For example, if we enable Trilinos then {\ttfamily pressio} automatically enables also Kokkos, BLAS, LAPACK and MPI. The reason for this choice is that in a production scenario---which is what pressio mainly targets---it is reasonable to expect a user to have Trilinos built with BLAS, LAPACK, MPI and Kokkos support.

There might be other constraints on the variables one can set. The reason for this is twofold\+: (a) to simplify what the user needs to provide; and (b) we belive some of these constraints are necessary, like the Trilinos example above or always requiring BLAS and LAPACK to be simulateneously on.\hypertarget{md_pages_installation_autotoc_md154}{}\doxysection{In practice, what are the steps to get, install and use Pressio?}\label{md_pages_installation_autotoc_md154}
todo\+: add description for using pressio without configuring, so one has to define the options directly when configuring their code or inside the code directly.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone \href{https://github.com/Pressio/pressio}{\texttt{ pressio}} (defaults to the main branch), or you can pick a \href{https://github.com/Pressio/pressio/releases}{\texttt{ release version}} 


\item Create a build and install subdirectories 


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio>}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build \&\& mkdir install}

\end{DoxyCode}
 


\item Use cmake to configure by passing to the comand line the target list of cmake variables to define. ~\newline
 For example, suppose we want to enable support for Trilinos and the debug prints. We would do\+: 


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export PRESSIO\_SRC=<where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio>}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio>/build}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/D CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=../install \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{      -\/D PRESSIO\_ENABLE\_TPL\_TRILINOS=ON \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{      -\/D PRESSIO\_ENABLE\_DEBUG\_PRINT=ON \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{      \$\{PRESSIO\_SRC\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{make install \# nothing is built, just headers copied to installation}

\end{DoxyCode}
 

{\itshape Note that this step does {\bfseries{not}} build anything because {\ttfamily pressio} is header-\/only, but only processes the cmake arguments and copies the pressio headers to the install prefix} {\ttfamily $<$where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio$>$/install}.~\newline
 If you want, inspect the file {\ttfamily $<$where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio$>$/install/presssio\+\_\+cmake\+\_\+config.h} which contains the cmake variables configuration.

We also remark that during the configuration step above pressio does not need to know where a target TPL exists in your system. In the configuration step above, you are simply telling Pressio that you have a certain TPL and want to enable the corresponding code in pressio. The TPLs will be needed at linking stage when you build {\itshape your} code that {\itshape uses} pressio.


\item When building your application to use pressio, you just have to point to the installation directory {\ttfamily $<$where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio$>$/install} with the installed pressio headers, and you can access all pressio functionalities via the C++ include {\ttfamily \#include$<$pressio.\+hpp$>$}\+: 


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include "{}pressio/what\_you\_need.hpp"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// ...}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} main()\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{comment}{// do something}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
  
\end{DoxyEnumerate}



\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The procedure above is advised because it enables {\ttfamily pressio} to properly process the cmake options and turn on/off based on certain conditions (as explained above). The alternative way to use pressio would be to just clone the repo, point to the {\ttfamily $<$where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio$>$/include} subdirectory and use cmake variables directly when building your code. However, this could have unexpected consequences since you would be resposible to set the variables correctly but you would not know exactly all the possible constraints. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
