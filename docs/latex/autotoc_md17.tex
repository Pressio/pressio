This page describes the structure of C++ pressio library. By the end, you should be able to understand the structure with its main packages, and the logic behind.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The pressio C++ library is divided into several packages\+:

\end{longtabu}
The top-\/down order used above is informative of the dependency structure. For example, every package depends on {\ttfamily mpl}. The {\ttfamily ops} package depends only on {\ttfamily mpl}, {\ttfamily utils}, {\ttfamily containers}. At the bottom of the stack we have the {\ttfamily rom} package which requires all the others.

Splitting the framework into separate packages has several benefits.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Maintability\+: {\ttfamily pressio} can be more easily developed and maintained since packages depend on one another through well-\/defined public interfaces, and appropriate namespaces are used to organize classes.
\item Selective usability\+: this modular framework allows users, if needed, to leverage invidual packages. For instance, if a user needs/wants just the QR methods, they can simply use that package, and all the dependencies on the others are enabled automatically.
