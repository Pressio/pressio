 {\itshape Leading-\/edge projection-\/based reduced order models (p\+R\+O\+Ms) for dynamical systems in science and engineering.}

You landed on the documentation of the C++ library, which is one component of the \href{https://pressio.github.io/}{\texttt{ Pressio project}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{In a nutshell}\label{index_autotoc_md29}
Pressio provides model reduction functionalities applicable to any system expressible as \[ \frac{d \boldsymbol{y}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y},t; ...) \] where $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $f$ is the F\+OM velocity, and $t$ is time.

We leverage this simple, expressive mathematical framework as a pivotal design choice to enable a minimal application programming interface (A\+PI) that is natural to dynamical systems. To use Pressio, you only need to create an {\itshape adapter class} to expose the right-\/hand-\/side of your system and optionally the action of its Jacobian. Schematically, Pressio exchanges data with your application as shown below\+: \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{index_autotoc_md30}
