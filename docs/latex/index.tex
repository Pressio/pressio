 {\itshape Leading-\/edge projection-\/based reduced order models (p\+R\+O\+Ms) for dynamical systems in science and engineering.}

You landed on the documentation of the C++ library! If this is a mistake, please go back to the \href{https://pressio.github.io/}{\texttt{ project website}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{index_autotoc_md30}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item learn about the \href{./md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install.html}{\texttt{ installation process}};
\item read the description of \href{./md_pages_getstarted_packages.html}{\texttt{ packages}} composing this C++ library;
\item the tutorials are divided in two drop-\/down tabs\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1.html}{\texttt{ tutorialsA}}\+: these use data structures/types that are {\itshape known} to pressio. ~\newline
Pressio {\itshape recognizes} them and has built-\/in support for kernels to operate on them;
\item \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1udops.html}{\texttt{ tutorialsB}}\+: these use data structures/types that are {\itshape unknown} to pressio. ~\newline
Pressio detects them as {\itshape arbitrary} types, and the user {\bfseries{has to}} provide kernels for operating on them;
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item dig into the \href{https://github.com/Pressio/pressio/tree/master/tests/rom/burgers1d}{\texttt{ test subdirectory}} of the C++ library.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysection{What if your types are not natively supported in pressio?}\label{index_autotoc_md31}
Check if your types are supported by lookig at the \href{md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install.html}{\texttt{ dependencies}}\+: if they are listed there, most likely you are good to go, and you don\textquotesingle{}t need to provide extra information to pressio.

Not supported? You can file an \href{https://github.com/Pressio/pressio/issues}{\texttt{ issue}} to request it and wait on it, or can proceed as in \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1udops.html}{\texttt{ tutorialsB}}.
