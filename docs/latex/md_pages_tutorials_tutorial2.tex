pressio4py supports different variants of Galerkin, as we will show in subsequent tutorials. The \char`\"{}default\char`\"{} qualification in pressio4py refers to a formulation that does {\itshape not} use hyper-\/reduction. Suppose that your full-\/order model (F\+OM) is written as \[ \frac{d \boldsymbol{y}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y},t; \boldsymbol{\mu}), \quad \boldsymbol{y}(0;\boldsymbol{\mu}) = \boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{\mu}), \]

where $y$ is the F\+OM state and $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity. Both $y$ and $f$ are large, see figure below. 



\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
pressio4py defines a {\itshape default Galerkin} problem as\+: \[ \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = \mathbf{\phi}^T \mathbf{f} \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) \]
\end{DoxyParagraph}
where $\hat{y}$ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{ref}$ is a reference F\+OM state, $\phi$ is the orthonormal basis, and $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity. Schematically, this system corresponds to the figure below. \hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial2_autotoc_md58}{}\doxysection{How to create a default Galerkin problem?}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial2_autotoc_md58}
To create a default Galerkin problem object, one needs\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item a F\+OM object satisfying the A\+PI described \mbox{[}here\mbox{]}()
\item a linear decoder (see \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}})
\item a rom state
\item a F\+OM reference state
\item \mbox{[}optional\mbox{]} an object with specific kernels when the F\+OM types are not natively supported by pressio.~\newline
 See \href{./md_pages_custom_ops_default_gal_exp.html}{\texttt{ this page}} for more information on this.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Synopsis\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{using} ode\_tag = pressio::ode::explicitmethods::Euler;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{using} pressio::rom::galerkin::createDefaultProblem;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto} Problem = createDefaultProblem<ode\_tag>(fomObj, decoder, yRom, yRef, [, opsObject]);}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note the function is templated on the ode tag. To select a different time stepping scheme, one can change the tag. To see the list of currently supported explicit stepping schemes, seetodo.\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial2_autotoc_md59}{}\doxysection{How to solve a default Galerkin problem?}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial2_autotoc_md59}
Once the target problem object is created, the reduced system can be integrated in time. Here we provide the most basic function to do so, which advances the system for a fixed number of steps. Synopsis\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// solve for fixed number of steps and time step}}
\DoxyCodeLine{pressio::rom::galerkin::solveNSteps(problem,     \# problem \textcolor{keywordtype}{object}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                    yRom,        \# rom state to advance}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                    t0,          \# initial time}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                    dt,          \# time step}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                    Nsteps       \# number of steps}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                    [, observer] \# optional observer}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                   )}
\end{DoxyCode}


The optional argument allows one to pass an \char`\"{}observer\char`\"{} object whose purpose is to monitor the evolution of the reduced state. The observer is called back by pressio4py during the time integration at every time step. This can be useful to, e.\+g., save the generalized coordinates, or usign them to perfom some other operation.
