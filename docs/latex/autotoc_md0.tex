The adapter class sits between pressio and the external application. This adapter class---if needed---must meet a specific A\+PI.

Pressio supports two variants of the A\+PI, a so-\/called {\itshape continuous-\/time} and {\itshape discrete-\/time} version. The continuous-\/time A\+PI operates such that the user is responsible to compute the continuous-\/time operators, e.\+g., the velocity, and pressio assembles the discrete-\/time operators. It is an A\+PI that very expressive of the formulation on which pressio relies on. The discrete-\/time A\+PI is designed such that the user is given the necessary operators and operands needed to assemble the time-\/discrete operators directly.

todo\+: why are we forced to keep these two separate? explain

todo\+: discuss pros and cons of the two A\+P\+Is

The following table illustrates what A\+PI is supported for each R\+OM
