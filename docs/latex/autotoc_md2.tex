todo discuss what is Galerkin R\+OM, the variants of the problem and what we support.

todo\+: discuss that the types exposed must be compatible and make sense.

 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{class }Adapter\{
\textcolor{keyword}{public}:
  \textcolor{keyword}{using} scalar\_type =
  \textcolor{keyword}{using} state\_type =
  \textcolor{keyword}{using} velocity\_type =
  \textcolor{keyword}{using} dense\_matrix\_type =

\textcolor{keyword}{public}:
  velocity\_type createVelocity() \textcolor{keyword}{const};
  \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} velocity(state, time, velo) \textcolor{keyword}{const};
\};
\end{DoxyCode}
 

The discrete-\/time A\+PI for Galerkin is the same as for all methods, and you can see it \href{./md_pages_adapter_apis_adapter_discrete_time_api.html}{\tt here}.
