## Scope and overview

@m_class{m-note m-info}

@parblock
Provides functionalities implementing various strategies
to "update" some information (i.e., a state) via an object
that satisfies a "steppable" concept (more details below).
@endparblock


Why is this useful? Suppose that you have a generic application/usecase
involving the concept of a discrete time or just discrete steps,
a notion of "state" that defines your information at a specific step,
and a "stepper" object, i.e. an object/abstraction that accepts a state
and knows how to take a "step" to update that state.
In such a scenario, it can be useful to have different strategies
to advance the state, for example: advancing for a fixed number of times,
advancing until a certain condition is met, etc.
This is what the `pressio/ode_advancers` provide.
We are growing this capability, so if you need something but it is
not alrady supported, open an issue or a PR on [github](https://github.com/Pressio/pressio).

Obviously, this is not necessarily specific to applied math problems or
scientific computing applications, but can be something generic.
In the context of scientific computing, one might immediately recognize
these functions to be useful for *time integration* of dynamical systems.
This is the reason why these functionalities are currently inside `pressio::ode`,
and this is also why we specifically use "time" below.
Later on, we might move or generalize them.

## Parameters and Requirements

- `stepper`:
  - the steppable object, must conform to:
  ```cpp
  class SteppableClass
  {
    public:
	void operator()(StateType & state,
					const TimeType current_time,
					const TimeType time_step_size_to_use,
					const int32_t step_count
					/*[, other arguments needed: these will be forwarded to your
					stepper object by the advance methods as shown above ]*/)
   {
     // do what you need to update state
   }
  };
  ```

- `state`: self-explanatory

- `start_time`: self-explanatory

- `final_time`: self-explanatory

- `num_steps`: self-explanatory

- `time_ste_size_manager`:
  - functor for setting the time step size
  ```cpp
  class StepSizeSetter
  {
    public:
    void operator()(const int32_t step_count,
				    const TimeType time,
					TimeType & dt) const
   {
     // update somehow dt
   }
  };
  ```

- `observer`:
  - functor to "observe" the state during the time integration,
  allowing you to potentially collect necessary data/metrics/statistics.
  Must conform to:
  ```cpp
  class ObserverClass
  {
    public:
    void operator()(const int32_t & step_count,
				    const TimeType current_time,
					const StateType & current_state) const;
  };
  ```

- `args...`: optional objects to forward to stepper's `operator()` that are
potentially needed to perform one step.
Note that these are optional, because your stepper might not need anything.
The advance functions will simply forward all these to the `operator()`
of the stepper object. Is having these optional argument really needed?
One might argue that if the stepper needs to have access to
some objects, then these auxiliary objects can be passed to the stepper
upon construction, and so the stepper would already have access to them
when its `operator()` is called.
This is true *if* there is a valid reason for making these auxiliary object
data members of the steppable class.
The problem with this approach is that the stepper would need to know
about all theses other types, and this creates a very tight
coupling between different objects,
that might be not even needed.
By letting users provide a pack to the advance functions,
we are able to decouple this structure such that any object
*only* needed within the stepper's `operator()` can be directly passed.
To explain this, look at the example below.

## When are the variadic arguments useful?

For example in a scenario like the following:

```cpp
struct SteppableClass
{
  template<class AuxiliaryType>
  void operator()(StateType & state,
				  const TimeType current_time,
				  const TimeType time_step_size_to_use,
				  const int32_t step_count,
				  AuxiliaryType & aux)
  {
     const int value = aux.doComplicateCalculation();
	 if (value % 2 == 0){
	   // update state somehow
     }
	 else{
	   // update state in a different way
	 }
  }
};

class Foo{
  int doComplicateCalculation(){}
};

class Bar{
  int doComplicateCalculation(){}
};

template<class AuxType>
void run()
{
  AuxType a;
  advance_n_steps(stepper, /*state*/, /*start t*/, /*step size*/, /*num steps*/, a);
}

int main()
{
  SteppableClass stepper;
  run<Foo>();
  run<Bar>();
}
```

Here, we don't want to parametrize the `StepperClass`
on the auxiliary class needed because we don't need it as member.
We just need to access the auxiliary class inside the `operator()`.
